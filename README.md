# Interess
Interess is a (to-be) social media forum where people can find local friends and dates based on common interests. Users can post to a variety of topics and see posts near them based on encrypted location information that will not be shared.
## Development
For now, Interess is being developed in node.js and express using EJS templates. I'd like to switch to a Rust backend eventually, but I'm not good enough at Rust yet for that to be a realistic goal any time soon.
